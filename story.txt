This is a document explaining the setup, key-words, dialogue options and more.

===setup===
setup is quite simple, have as many participents
but once the story has initiated, no other participents can join.

this may seem harsh, however story telling is complex and requires
a base theme, rules and number of people before the story is started.

-base theme.
the base theme is one of the more important parts about your story!
who is your character?
are you young or old?
what is your hair color?
explore your character and create them as if you know this person.

where are you currently now?
what time-zone are you in?
much like your character, your world should be explored
in great detail during play.

===rules===
there are three types of rules to keep in mind.

-story rule

the story must not leave the planned settup without a valid reason.

-readers rule 
readers must remain within their decided characters and traits.
readers may have inputs and dialogue but not such way which changes scenes.

-story tellers rule 

cannot change the story setup after agreed apon
or favour any character over another.

story teller is the only person who may change scene with a valid reason.
===roles===

two main roles. the reader and the story teller.

-reader

a reader can perform actions based on the tellers wording, ect.
Cannot change scenes and may not alter items in the world as the teller may already have them set.

-story teller

builds the world around you.
a good story teller should give the reader
something to react to but also keep in mind
making things short with small details can
make a big difference.

===tips===
try to mark down important information and key points in the story
it may help to remind you where you left off.
